Subscriptions and hardening the primary library is our current focus. Once both are complete we'll be ready to move from Beta to v1.0.

The first preview of subscriptions will be available in mid November around Thanksgiving.

> **TL:DR;** Coming End of Q4, 2019.

In short we are:

-   Conforming to the [GraphQL over WebSocket](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol defined by Apollo.
-   Provide a set of interfaces to plug in your own messaging implementation as needed.
